## Overview:

Torixyna is an innovative library designed to simplify and optimize the development of applications on Windows.
Its main goal is to reduce the amount of code needed to accomplish complex tasks such as managing speakers, registries, privileges, and much more...

Torixyna is highly modular: you must specify preprocessor directives to include a particular module in your project. Without this, the module will not be integrated.

This approach prevents unused modules from being added to the final program. In the long term, with the addition of many more modules, this method ensures that even professional projects remain lightweight and efficient, without generating gigantic executables. Torixyna thus allows developers to save valuable time while ensuring their applications stay optimized.




## Why choose Torixyna ?

- Simplicity : With its modular design, Torixyna reduces the complexity of interacting with Windows APIs.

- Performance : Using native Windows libraries, the library is optimized to run smoothly and efficiently.

- Save time : No more complex coding for each project, Torixyna offers you ready-to-use solutions.
